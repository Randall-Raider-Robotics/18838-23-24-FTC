# Outreach - Randall Robotics Team FTC 2023-2024

Welcome to the Outreach section of the Randall Robotics Team's GitHub repository for the FTC 2023-2024 season. In this section, we document and share our community outreach efforts and activities. We believe in giving back to our community and inspiring others to explore the exciting world of robotics and STEM education.

## Outreach Initiatives

### Online resources
We've worked on other online projects.

### Robotics Workshops

We conduct hands-on robotics workshops for local schools and community organizations. These workshops introduce participants to basic robotics concepts, programming, and problem-solving. Our team members serve as mentors and provide guidance throughout the learning process.

### School Visits

We visit local schools to showcase our robot, share our experiences, and encourage students to pursue STEM education and robotics. These visits include live robot demonstrations, presentations, and Q&A sessions.

### Community Events

Our team actively participates in community events and fairs. We set up interactive robotics booths where attendees can engage with our robots, learn about our team, and gain insights into the world of robotics and technology.

### FIRST Outreach

As part of the FIRST community, we collaborate with other FTC teams and participate in joint outreach activities. This allows us to extend our impact and reach a wider audience of aspiring young engineers and innovators.

## How to Get Involved

If you're interested in partnering with us for an outreach event or workshop or if you'd like to invite us to your school or community event, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Outreach Coordinator:
